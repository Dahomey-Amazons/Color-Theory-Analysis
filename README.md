## Introduction

The Myntra Color Palette Generator is an innovative tool designed to provide personalized color recommendations for fashion choices. By analyzing user-uploaded images, it extracts key color information and generates custom color palettes. This project aims to enhance the shopping experience on the Myntra app by offering tailored product recommendations based on users' unique color preferences.

## Features

- User-friendly interface resembling a mobile app
- Image upload functionality
- Color extraction for hair, skin, and eyes
- Personalized color palette generation
- Product recommendations based on generated palettes

## Installation

1. You can try out the basic version through the link, attached in our description.

## Usage

1. Click on the "Upload Image" button to select an image.
2. Use the "Hair Color", "Skin Color", and "Eye Color" buttons to select respective areas in the image.
3. The app will display the extracted colors and generate a recommended color palette.
4. Click "Show Recommended Products" to view fashion items that match your color palette (feature coming soon).

## Color Recommendation Process

1. Users take pictures of their face, skin, eyes, and hair under good lighting conditions on the Myntra app.
2. The app preprocesses the collected images and removes background noise.
3. Machine learning models extract key features from the images.
4. Based on the analysis, the app provides personalized color recommendations.
5. The app presents items to users in their preferred category and style, based on the colors of the personalized color palette.

## Technical Implementation

### Prerequisites

1. **Data Collection**: Gather a comprehensive dataset of color combinations, preferences, and associated attributes.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the data to ensure consistency and quality.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Extract relevant features from the color data, such as RGB values, hue, saturation, brightness, etc.

### Machine Learning Models

1. **Color Clustering**:
- K-means Clustering
- DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)

2. **Preference Prediction**:
- Decision Trees
- Random Forests
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)

3. **Deep Learning (Optional)**:
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

## Future Enhancements

- Implement machine learning models for more accurate color recommendations
- Integrate with Myntra's product database for real-time product suggestions
- Add user accounts and preference saving functionality
- Develop mobile app versions for iOS and Android
